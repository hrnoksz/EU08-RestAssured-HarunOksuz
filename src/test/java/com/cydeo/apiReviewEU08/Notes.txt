All about Request and Response

Postman for manually test APIs, but postman can be used in an automated way

We use RestAssured Library to automate API testing

Request : What do we need? End point = URL + path parameters
is query parameter part of the URL? No

    *We need Headers: content type + authorization
    *POST, PUT and PATCH request (you might need body)

RESPONSE: We verify headers, status code and body
Verifying body: 6 approach
