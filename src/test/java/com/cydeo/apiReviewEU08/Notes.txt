All about Request and Response

Postman for manually test APIs, but postman can be used in an automated way

We use RestAssured Library to automate API testing

Request : What do we need? End point = URL + path parameters
is query parameter part of the URL? No

    *We need Headers: content type + authorization
    *POST, PUT and PATCH request (you might need body)

Understanding API Documentation will get you The JOB (Swagger Documentation)

RESPONSE: We verify headers, status code and body
Verifying body: 6 approach
                -String method
                -path
                -jsonPath
                -hamCrest matchers

               Deserialization: Which method we call? as() method
                -json to Java Collection
                -json to POJO (Plain Old Java Object)
                -We need Object Mappers (Data Binders): Jackson, Gson Dependency (inside pom.xml)
                -We will mostly use this for GET requests

                Serialization:
                -Java to Json
                -We use body() method
                -POST, PUT, PATCH requests

        **Path and JsonPath are using Gpath Syntax
